# Sentiment-analyzer
This machine learning model analyzes the sentiment of any message through a kaggle dataset, NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, NLTK for text preprocessing, and Scikit-learn for machine learning. Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.

The project now includes data augmentation, using WordNet to create training diversity. And uses GridSearchCV with cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
